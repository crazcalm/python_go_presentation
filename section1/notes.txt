build notes:
The go command to build a shared library is as follows:

`go build -o output_file.so  -buildmode=c-shared source_file.go`

Example:
`go build -o hello_world.so  -buildmode=c-shared hello_world.go`


Go file notes:
- You cannot have a space between the comment and the worl "export"
  - Example: "// export" is a no go. The header file will not be created.


Speech:
-------

- What is a shared object file? Give a breif description and usage example.

- As of go1.5, golang has been able to build shared object files.
  - View example and explain code.

- (after running the file) Lets take second to obsorb what we just did. We ran 
a python file that loaded a shared object file, which called a go function that 
printed "Hello World" to the screen. That is pretty cool!
