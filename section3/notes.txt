In this section, I need to talk about realistic scenarios in which wrapping go 
in python is a reasonable option. I would like to talk about go's speed and 
concurrency.

Speed:
- Deciding whether or not a number is prime. I can write Euler's equations in 
both python, go, and go wrapped in python and compare the results.

Concurrency:
- I have no idea (vampire number? maybe)
- Given that I can only pass ints between go and python, unless you use one 
number to in such a way that you have to compute multiple possiblities, I am 
not sure how we can use the concurrency...
- Idea: Given a number, find the closest prime number.
  - Given 8, 7 is the answer
  - Given 7, 7 in the answer
  - Given 6, 5 and 7 are the answer.

- Idea2:
  - Given a number, return its prime factorization?
