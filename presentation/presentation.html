                    <section>
                       <p>We are going to write a go program. Make a 
shared object out of that program, and then call that program from python</p>

                        <p>Shared Object file?</p>

                        <p>Shared libraries are libraries that are loaded 
by programs when they start. In terms of convention, these files are 
usually kept in a special place and given special names. You can read more 
about that at 
http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO/shared-libraries.html
</p>

                        <p>For our purposes, we need to know that we can 
build shared object files via Go and the name of these files end in ".so".

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <section>
                        <p>The ability to use Go to Create shared objects files 
anddynamically call them in Python is cool! It is also very hard to have these two 
languages talk directly to each other.</p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <p>However, if you do not need Go and Python to talk 
directly to one another, then you are <b>GOLDEN!</b></p>

                    <p>You can then store all the data that needs to be 
passed from one language to the other files that can then be read and 
written to by both Go and Python.</p>
