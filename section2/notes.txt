Now that we know it is possible to call a go function from python, it is time 
to test the limits of what we can do.

In order to do that, we have to note that this method of calling go from python 
has two points of failure; function input and funtion output. The object that 
python passes to a go function must map to a go like object for go to be able 
to act on it. And, when go returns an object to python, that object must map to 
python like object for python to act on it.

Some of python's basics types include int, float, string, list, and dict.

Lets see how many of these data types can be passed to and interpreted by go!

Part 2:
-------

Some of Go's basic types inclide int, float64, string, slice, and map.

Lets see how many of these data types can python can handle!

Int case:
---------
- Works fine? Try a few numbers, then try "10000000000"

Float case:
----------
- Try anything because everything fails...

String case:
------------
- Try "hello world", "hello", "Hello World", "hi", and "Hello World       "

Part 3:
------

The next step would be to test cases that invlove both input and output, but I 
am going to skip that part because it stands to reason that input that worked 
can be matched to any of the outputs that worked.
